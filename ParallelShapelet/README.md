Using GPU to accelerate the shapelet analysis of time series is an important method of time series classification. One single GPU can accelerate the speed of analysis by more than 10 times, and we plan to apply this to ICDE later. This is also one of our impotant AI achievements to be implemented on the Matrix project.
